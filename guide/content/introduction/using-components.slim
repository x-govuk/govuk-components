title: Using components
---

markdown:
  You can use view components in Rails templates by:

  * passing a ViewComponent object to Rails’ `render` method directly
  * using the packaged helpers that build and render the ViewComponent

  The result and functionality of the components is the same
  regardless of approach.

  ## Capturing content

  This library uses Rails' default capture functionality. It’s intended to work
  with strings but [renders nothing](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/17661)
  when other kinds of objects are provided. For example, if we capture a
  floating point number and a string in a `tag#span` block, only the string is
  rendered.

  ```language-slim
  = tag.span { 1.0 }
  = tag.span { "2.0" }
  ```

  ```language-html
  <span></span>
  <span>2.0</span>
  ```

  ## Using component objects directly

  Rails supports the rendering of ViewComponent objects natively. You can
  pass them straight to `render` in your template.

  ```language-slim
  = render(GovukComponent::InsetTextComponent.new(text: "Important message"))
  ```

  ## Using the provided helper methods

  The helper methods make rendering components easier and they provide a more
  consistent experience when using with the [link helpers](/helpers/link) and
  [GOV.UK Form Builder](https://govuk-form-builder.x-govuk.org/).

  ```language-slim
  = govuk_inset_text(text: "Important message")
  ```

== ActionController::Base.render(component_helper_mapping_table)
