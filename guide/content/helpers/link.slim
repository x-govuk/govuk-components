markdown:
  In addition to the components, this gem also comes with link helpers that are
  often reimplemented across projects.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Regular link",
  code: dsfr_link_to_normal) do

  p.govuk-body

  markdown:
    Regular links are just plain [anchor elements][0]
    with the `fr-link` class.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Inverse hyperlink",
  code: dsfr_link_to_inverse,
  inverse: true) do

  p.govuk-body
    | Use inverse hyperlinks on dark backgrounds.

== render('/partials/example.*',

  ## Class helpers

  Rails has [lots of link helpers][0]
  and only the most frequently used are wrapped by this library. If you need
  to use another variant, like `link_to_if`, you can use the
  `dsfr_link_classes` and `dsfr_button_classes`
  helpers to ensure the correct classes are assigned.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Using the class helpers",
  code: dsfr_link_classes_multiple) do

  p.govuk-body
    markdown:
      When no arguments are provided to `dsfr_link_classes`, only
      the default `fr-link` will be added. Alternate styles
      can be passed in as a snake cased array of variants.
