title: GOV.UK header
---

markdown:
  The GOV.UK header shows users that they are on GOV.UK and which service they
  are using.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Default header",
  code: header_normal) do

  markdown:
    Use the default header if your service has 5 pages or fewer.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Header with a product name",
  code: header_with_custom_product_name)

  markdown:
    This is used when the product name follows on directly from ‘GOV.UK’. For example, GOV.UK Pay or GOV.UK Design System. In most circumstances, you should use a  service name instead.

    Use the `homepage_url` to link to your product homepage.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Header with an alternative logo",
  code: header_with_custom_logo) do

  markdown:
    If an alternative logo is needed, it can be set using the `custom_logo` slot.
    This example uses an SVG graphic paired with text.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Header with service navigation and phase banner",
  code: header_with_service_nav_and_phase_banner,
  data: header_with_service_nav_and_phase_banner_data) do

  markdown:
    The header component is rendered inside a `<header>` element automatically. You can place
    [service navigation](/components/service-navigation) and a [phase banner](/components/service-navigation) alongside using
    the provided slots.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Adding more content to the header",
  code: header_with_extra_content) do

  markdown:
    Additional content can be added to the header by passing it in via the block. This is useful for adding sign in and sign out links or other account information.

== render('/partials/related-navigation.*', links: header_info)
