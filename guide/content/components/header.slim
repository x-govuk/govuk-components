title: GOV.UK header
---

markdown:
  The GOV.UK header shows users that they are on GOV.UK and which service they
  are using.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Default header",
  code: header_normal) do

  markdown:
    Use the default header if your service has 5 pages or fewer.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Header with service name",
  code: header_with_service_name) do

  markdown:
    Use the header with a service name if your service is more than 5 pages long - this can help users understand which service they are using.

    The service name can be set using the `service_name` keyword argument.

    The GOV.UK logo should link to the the GOV.UK homepage, and the service name should link to your service homepage.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Header with a product name",
  code: header_with_custom_product_name)

  markdown:
    This is used when the product name follows on directly from ‘GOV.UK’. For example, GOV.UK Pay or GOV.UK Design System. In most circumstances, you should use a  service name instead.

    Use the `homepage_url` to link to your product homepage.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Header with navigation items",
  code: header_with_navigation_items)

  markdown:
    Navigation items can be added using the `navigation_item` slot. When viewed
    on mobile, they will appear in a dropdown menu.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Header with an alternative logo",
  code: header_with_custom_logo_and_service_name) do

  markdown:
    If an alternative logo is needed, it can be set using the `custom_logo` slot.
    This example uses an SVG graphic paired with text.

== render('/partials/related-navigation.*', links: header_info)
