title: Accordion
---

markdown:
  The accordion component lets users show and hide sections of related content
  on a page.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Creating a simple accordion",
  code: accordion_normal) do

  markdown:
    Each accordion section requires `heading_text` to be set. The content is
    built from any markup that is passed in via the block.

    Sections can be automatically expanded by setting `expanded: true`.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Creating an accordion with section summaries",
  code: accordion_with_section_summaries) do

  markdown:
    If the section needs more of an explanation, you can optionally add a
    summary line using the `summary_text` keyword.

    Keep summary lines as short as possible.

== render('/partials/related-navigation.*', links: accordion_info)
