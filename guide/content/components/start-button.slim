title: Start button

markdown:
  Use a start button for the main call to action on your serviceâ€™s
  #{govuk_link_to('start page', 'https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/start-pages/').html_safe}.

  Start buttons don't usually submit form data, so they use a link tag rather
  than a button tag.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Start button",
  code: start_button_normal)

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Rendering a start button in a form",
  code: start_button_as_button) do

  markdown:
    If you need to submit data you can make the component render a form
    containing a button instead of a link by passing `as_button: true`. This
    approach uses the Rails `button_to` helper and will render a form that
    will `POST` to the target URL.
