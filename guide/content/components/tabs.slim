  markdown:
    The tabs component have a `title`, which is displayed above a list of jump links on narrow screens or if javascript is unavailable. This defaults to ‘Contents’ but can be changed if needed.

    Each tab requires a `label` which will form the link at the top.

    The content can be set by using either a block of HTML, or the `text` argument.
