title: Breadcrumbs
---

markdown:
  The breadcrumbs component helps users to understand where they are within a
  website’s structure and move between levels.

  Always place breadcrumbs at the top of a page, before the `<main>` element.
  Placing them here means that the [‘Skip to main content’ link](/helpers/skip-link/)
  allows the user to skip all navigation links, including breadcrumbs.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Breadcrumbs with default arguments",
  code: breadcrumbs_normal,
  data: breadcrumbs_data_three_levels) do

  markdown:
    Breadcrumbs need to be provided in a Hash where the keys are the page name and the values are the path.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Breadcrumbs that collapse on mobile",
  code: breadcrumbs_that_collapse_on_mobile,
  data: breadcrumbs_data_five_levels) do

  markdown:
    If you have long breadcrumbs, you can configure the component to only show
    the first and last items on mobile devices.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Breadcrumbs from an array of links",
  code: breadcrumbs_from_an_array_of_links,
  data: breadcrumbs_array_of_links) do

  markdown:
    If you need more control over the breadcrumbs you can pass in any array of
    links.

    The `govuk_breadcrumb_link_to` helper generates links with the
    `govuk-breadcrumbs__link` class.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Breadcrumbs with inverted colours",
  code: breadcrumbs_inverted,
  data: breadcrumbs_nav_hierarchy,
  inverse: true) do

  markdown:
    When breadcrumbs are displayed on darker backgrounds the `inverse` keyword
    argument can be used to make them readable.

== render('/partials/related-navigation.*', links: breadcrumbs_info)
