title: Exit this page
---

markdown:
  Give users a way to quickly and safely exit a service, website or
  application. Keyboard-only users can quickly tap the shift key 3 times to
  exit the page.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Exit this page with no parameters",
  code: exit_this_page_normal) do

  markdown:
    When called with no additional arguments the component renders a button
    that links to BBC Weather. The default link target can be changed in the
    [library configuration options](/introduction/configuration/).

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Exit this page with custom text and URL",
  code: exit_this_page_custom_link_and_text) do

  markdown:
    Both the link text and redirect URL can be overridden with arguments. For
    consistency with other link helpers, `href` can be used instead of
    `redirect_url`.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Exit this page with custom HTML",
  code: exit_this_page_custom_html) do

  markdown:
    Any HTML can be provided to the exit this page component using a block.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Adding a secondary link to the top of the page",
  code: exit_this_page_link_helper) do

  markdown:
    In addition to the component a link can be added alongside the
    [skip link](/helpers/skip-link) that allows people to quickly exit the site
    using their keyboard.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Overriding the assistive text",
  code: exit_this_page_with_custom_assistive_text) do

  markdown:
    When operating in keyboard mode screen readers will announce the following events:

    * activation (configured with `activated_text`)
    * timing out (configured with `timed_out_text`)
    * press two more times to exit (configured with `press_two_more_times_text`)
    * press one more time to exit (configured with `press_one_more_time_text`)

    The defaults can be overwritten application wide by setting the appropriate
    values [in the configuration](/introduction/configuration/).

== render('/partials/related-navigation.*', links: exit_this_page_info)
