This gem provides a suite of reusable components for the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/). It is intended to provide a lightweight alternative to the [GOV.UK Publishing Components](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_publishing_components) library and is built with GitHub’s [ViewComponent](https://github.com/github/view_component) framework.

It aims to implement the functionality from the original Nunjucks macros in a way that will feel more familiar to Rails developers. Blocks are preferred over strings of HTML, beneath the surface each component is just a Ruby object, everything is inheritable and overrideable.

## Documentation

The gem comes with [a full guide](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/) that covers most aspects of day-to-day use, along with code and output examples. The examples in the guide (and the guide itself) are built using the components, so it will always be up to date.

## What’s included?

All of the non-form components from the GOV.UK Design System are implemented by this library as ViewComponents. Form components are implemented by the [GOV.UK Form Builder](https://govuk-form-builder.netlify.app/).

The provided components are:

* [Accordion](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/accordion)
* [Back link](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/back-link)
* [Breadcrumbs](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/breadcrumbs)
* [Cookie banner](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/cookie-banner)
* [Details](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/details)
* [Exit this page](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/exit-this-page)
* [Footer](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/footer)
* [Header](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/header)
* [Inset text](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/inset-text)
* [Notification banner](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/notification-banner)
* [Panel](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/panel)
* [Pagination](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/pagination)
* [Phase banner](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/phase-banner)
* [Section break](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/section-break)
* [Start button](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/start-button)
* [Summary list](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/summary-list)
* [Tabs](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/tabs)
* [Tables](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/table)
* [Tags](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/tag)
* [Task list](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/task-list)
* [Warning text](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/components/warning-text)

This library also provides helpers for creating [links](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/helpers/link),
[buttons](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/helpers/button), [skip links](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/helpers/skip-link)
and [back to top links](https://govuk-components.netlify.app/helpers/back-to-top-link).

## Alternative syntax

All of the components can be rendered in two ways:

* directly using Rails’ `#render` method:

  ```erb
    <%= render GovukComponent::WarningTextComponent.new do %>
      A serious warning
    <% end %>
  ```

* via the helper wrapper:

  ```erb
    <%= govuk_warning_text do %>
      A serious warning
    <% end %>
  ```

  The naming convention for helpers is `govuk_` followed by the component’s name in snake case. You can see the full list in [GovukComponentsHelper](app/helpers/govuk_components_helper.rb).

## Example use

This library allows components to be rendered with Rails’ `render` method or via the provided helpers. Here we’ll use the `govuk_tabs` to render three tabbed sections:

```erb
<%= govuk_tabs(title: 'Days of the week') do |component| %>
  <% component.with_tab(label: 'Monday') do %>
    <p>Monday’s child is fair of face</p>
  <% end %>

  <% component.with_tab(label: 'Tuesday') do %>
    <p>Tuesday’s child is full of grace</p>
  <% end %>

  <% component.with_tab(label: 'Wednesday') do %>
    <p>Wednesday’s child is full of woe</p>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

Here are the rendered tabs:
